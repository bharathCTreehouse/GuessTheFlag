# GuessTheFlag

This is a simple game built using SwiftUI wherein the user is presented with 3 buttons containing flags of various countries. Scores are calculated based on each correct answer and presented to the user in an alert. On selecting an incorrect option, an alert is presented with the country name of the tapped button.

Got exposed to the ZStack. We use it to stack up views one on top of another.

Also created a custom 'ViewModifier' and abstracted it inside a View extension so that it can be directly used like a function.
